# Part-of-the-paper-data-and-complete-code
a dynamic modeling and continuous optimization method for comprehensive carbon efficiency of hobbing based on data-driven discrete simulation
This code base contains the code of critic weight method, MAML-DNN, DEVS, MOSOA and 10 pieces of data that can be used for verification. The main function of this code base is to enable readers to verify the validity of the method proposed in the paper.
